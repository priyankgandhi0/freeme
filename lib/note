    	•	It will not allow me to select position so I cannot go past this section [You Have to Select Department First]
    	•	Too many folders per job[Done]
    	•	Once I select June 14, 15, 16 there are three new folders under that job. The only time it ever splits should when the job is past a work week (Work week is defined by Sunday through Saturday).[Done]
    	•	To reiterate, unless a job does not happen within a Sunday-Saturday week, it does not need an extra folder.[Done]
